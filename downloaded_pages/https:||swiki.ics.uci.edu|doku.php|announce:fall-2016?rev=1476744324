Fall Quarter 2016 Announcements (work in progress)


Technology Purchases


ICS Computing Support can help clarify solutions, identify resources that are already available to you, and put you in touch with vendors that offer reduced pricing on some software and hardware, so please check with us before making technology purchases.



Instructional Lab Updates


Keeping Instructional Labs Clean


Instructors, please urge your TAs to enforce the “NO FOOD or DRINKS” rule in the Instructional Labs.  The care for the labs is everyone's responsibility.


There are brand new chairs and desks in the first floor labs.  The carpets were replaced, and the walls were painted last summer.  Please make sure that your TAs and especially your students understand that we are all caretakers of this space.  How we leave these labs to the next crop of students reflects on all of us.  If anybody sees a student that is doing something in lab that they should be then they are encouraged to contact their TA, the lab attendant in CS 364 at x47553, or Computing Support at x44422.


Openlab Changes


 Added 40 more 8 core HP Proliant 360 G5's with 32GB RAM.

 Upgraded to CentOS 7 for Fall quarter.

 Consolidated openlab.q with no time limits.



More information on the Openlab Cluster


More information on using Son of Grid Engine Queueing System (SGE)


Undergraduate Scratch Space


Two (2) TB of space on the Bren School's filer have been set aside for undergraduate instruction scratch space. The space is available to both Windows (smb) and ICS supported Linux (nfs) clients.


From a Windows host, please use the smb path \\samba.ics.uci.edu\ugrad_space and enter your ICS credentials when prompted. 


From an supported ICS Linux host, this space may be accessed by this path:  /auto/ugrad_space.





ICS Supported Operating Systems


On qualifying hardware, ICS Compute Support can run the following operating systems with varying service levels.  


Please see our supported operating systems swiki page for full descriptions.




Operating System Type of Support 



CentOS 7 Full Support

Please visit the Modules swiki page for more information about adding these to your environment.



Cloud Computing and Virtual Machines


ICS Computing Support offers serval virtual computing environments Virtual Environments.  


Cloud Environments


ICS Computing Support can help you setup and design your cloud cluster and ICS environments can be extended to the cloud.


 Google Cloud Engine @ ICS

 Amazon Web Services @ UCI



Virtual Machines


Many public and research hosts are setup to run the following virtual environments.  


 Oracle Virtual Box

 Vagrant

 Docker






ICS Data Center Services


ICS has a 1600 square foot data center and manages 571 pieces of equipment in the data center including 479 bare metal servers.  More statistics are available here.


ICS researchers may place supported hardware in the ICS data center free of recurring charges.  Researchers are expected to pay for any infrastructure costs associated with their equipment and are occasionally asked to help with general infrastructure costs for running the data center.  



SSL Certificates for ICS Hosts


UC Irvine is participating in the InCommon Certificate program, which allows delegated administrators in campus departments to issue and renew digital certificates used for such purposes as securing web servers run on behalf of their department.  Through the InCommon Certificate program, UC Irvine pays a site fee (sponsored by OIT) and is then entitled to issue unlimited digital certificates through Comodo, a well-established commercial Certificate Authority.  


More information about this program is available at the InCommon site.  


Contacthelpdesk@ics.uci.edu for more information.



Take Attendance with CheckIn


If you need to take attendance for classes or meetings, you can use our web-based tool which is available at https://checkin.ics.uci.edu.  


Checking in can be done via cell phone or laptop.  For more information, visit https://checkin.ics.uci.edu/index.php?r=site/about



Licenses for Microsoft Office and Adobe Acrobat


Annually, ICS purchases licenses for Microsoft Office, Microsoft Windows, and Adobe Acrobat.  These can be installed on systems purchased with UCI funds.  They require periodic connectivity to the UCI network to keep the license activated.  Contact helpdesk@ics.uci.edu for more information.
