Michelle Nuño Selected to Participate in the 70th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting
May 13, 2020 

Statistics Ph.D. candidate Michelle Nuño was selected to participate in the 70th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting taking place in Lindau, Germany. Each year, around 30 to 40 Nobel Laureates convene in Lindau to meet the next generation of leading scientists: 600 undergraduates, Ph.D. students and post-doc researchers from all over the world.

“I was very excited to learn that I had been selected,” says Nuño. Although the meeting has been postponed because of the coronavirus, she plans to participate in several online activities at the end of June 2020 as well as attend the rescheduled event at the end of June 2021. “I can’t wait to meet all the students and Nobel Laureates!”
Nuño has been a recipient of the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Eugene Cota-Robles award and the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS). “My latest research focuses on extending existing methodology to help with biomarker discovery, particularly in Alzheimer’s disease,” she says. “Another project that I am currently working on considers how different eligibility criteria can impact the ability to detect a treatment effect in clinical trials for Alzheimer’s disease treatments.” The latter project will help investigators adequately design proof-of-concept trials for Alzheimer’s disease.
Nuño will be graduating from UCI this summer and joining USC and the Children’s Oncology Group as an assistant professor. “I am very excited about this position and being able to contribute to the research they are all doing!”
