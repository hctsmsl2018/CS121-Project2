Welcome To LUCI 








 




The Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction (LUCI) is a research group at the University of California, Irvine that brings together faculty and students in the School of Information and Computer Science who share research interests in the design and use of ubiquitous computing platforms, infrastructures, technologies, and applications.









 












Shaping The Way We Live 



The Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing (LUCI) works towards creating the future of technology that impacts our everyday lives. Whether if it’s developing wearable technology for children with autism,  learning the practices of data in city infrastructures, or understanding the many ways that minoritized communities resist data-intensive technologies – LUCI  lab is designing for social good.
