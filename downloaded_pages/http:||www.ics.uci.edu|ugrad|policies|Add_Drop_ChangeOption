Add, Drop, and Change Options
The Bren School strictly follows the campus policy for adding, dropping, and changing grade option or variable units for its courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.

It is the student's responsibility to be aware of deadlines and make the modifications to his or her schedule before those deadlines pass.
 

» Add, Drop, and Change Deadlines
Always check the course syllabus carefully for course specific add and drop information. If earlier add/drop deadliness are required by the instructor, enrollment will be controlled by the instructor with authorization codes.
The deadline to add or drop courses and to change grade option or variable units is 5:00pm on Friday of Week 2.
Once these deadlines have passed, an Enrollment Exception request must be submitted through Student Access.
The deadlne to submit a grade option change for non major courses through enrollment exceptions is 5:00pm on Friday of Week 10.

If your drop request is approved, please let your professor know as a courtesy once you have formally dropped the course.
 
» Course Time Conflicts
Time conflicts between courses may be approved on a case-by-case basis. Note that a lecture to lecture conflict will not be approved under any circumstances. If a course's lab or discussion time conflicts with another course's lecture, lab, or discussion, AND there are open spaces in both conflicting sections, follow these steps:

Enroll in one of the conflicting courses (if the conflict involves a lecture, be sure to enroll in the lecture).
Obtain written email approval from both instructors to allow the conflict.
Forward that approval to ucounsel@uci.edu. Be sure to provide the 5-digit course codes for the conflicting courses.
Allow ICS Student Affairs 2-3 business days to process the request. You will be notified by email when it has been reviewed.

» Enrollment Exception Requests
Requests to add or drop are reviewed by the academic advising office of the school offering the course, as well as the school of the student's major (if different). Requests to change grade option or variable units require the approval of the academic advising office of the student's major.
Enrollment exceptions for adds, drops or variable units in ICS are not guaranteed. Exception requests will only be approved for extenuating and documented circumstances outside of the student's control. It is therefore important to continue attending class meetings and keep up with the assignments until your request is fully processed. Enrollment Exceptions for grade option change requests will only be approved for non major courses. If a course can be applied to your major it will not approved. 
Requests will be denied if submitted for the following reasons:

You did not know the deadlines
You did not understand the Add/Drop process
You did not know the grade requirements for your degree
The course is not required to meet Major, School, or University requirements
You are doing poorly in the course because of difficulties with the course material
You are doing poorly in the course because of a heavy course/work load
You are doing poorly in the course because of failure to attend

If your drop request is approved, please let your professor know as a courtesy once you have formally dropped the course.
 
» Course Time Conflicts
Time conflicts between courses may be approved on a case-by-case basis. Note that a lecture to lecture conflict will not be approved under any circumstances. If a course's lab or discussion time conflicts with another course's lecture, lab, or discussion, AND there are open spaces in both conflicting sections, follow these steps:

Enroll in one of the conflicting courses (if the conflict involves a lecture, be sure to enroll in the lecture).
Obtain written email approval from both instructors to allow the conflict.
Forward that approval to ucounsel@uci.edu. Be sure to provide the 5-digit course codes for the conflicting courses.
Allow ICS Student Affairs 2-3 business days to process the request. You will be notified by email when it has been reviewed.
If approved, use WebReg to enroll in the conflicting section.
