Meet the Bytes
October 5th, DBH 6011 7-8PM

Bits & Bytes is a year long mentorship program organized by 
                ICS Student Council at UC Irvine to help new ICS students transition to 
                life at UCI through organized socials!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
                Group leaders, aka Bytes, will guide and provide a community at UCI for incoming
                 freshmen and transfers, aka Bits. Each group leader will be assigned 2 to 3 new 
                 students and each group leader will be paired with another group leader to form a "fam"!   
                 Both Bytes and Bits will have the chance to meet new friends and stay connected with the ICS 
                 community through events that promote academic success and community bonding.
