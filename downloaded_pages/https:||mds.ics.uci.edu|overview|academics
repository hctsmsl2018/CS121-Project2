Dual Focus on Theory and Practice 
















The UCI Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science MDS curriculum is designed to provide you with a strong foundation in modern data science. The MDS program differentiates itself by offering a dual-framework in Statistical and Computational methods to advance the knowledge base in the areas of Analytics and Modeling, Data Engineering, Deep Neural Networks, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Taught by pioneering faculty and researchers in the field of data science, students will be part of the only computational focused schools in the UC system and gain valuable hands-on experience through our industry partnered Capstone Project.  





































The 15-month MDS program consists of 13 courses – ten required core courses and three electives – for a minimum of 52 units.  

















 

















A key component to the program is the capstone project where you engage with our industry partners to develop models to mine insights. Under the supervision of faculty and industry professionals, the capstone project provides you with the preparation in project design, development, professional writing and oral presentation to be a leader in the field.  

















 












				Industry is learning quickly that people can scrape and analyze data, but to do something truly meaningful with data - to make decisions that will drive the industry forward you need the foundations of data science and understanding the statistics and computing methods.

Capstone Project 
















The Capstone Project provides students the opportunity to work on real-life data science problems with industry partners. The projects are comprehensive in scope, allowing students to demonstrate the breadth and depth of knowledge in data science. The Capstone Project will develop an empirically-driven solution to sponsoring organizations and will cover the full spectrum of the analytic process, from data gathering, manipulation, visualization, analysis, and interpretation of results. Students will work in small groups to put concepts and techniques together and put them in action.

Dual Focus on Theory and Practice 
















The UCI Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science MDS curriculum is designed to provide you with a strong foundation in modern data science. The MDS program differentiates itself by offering a dual-framework in Statistical and Computational methods to advance the knowledge base in the areas of Analytics and Modeling, Data Engineering, Deep Neural Networks, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. Taught by pioneering faculty and researchers in the field of data science, students will be part of the only computational focused schools in the UC system and gain valuable hands-on experience through our industry partnered Capstone Project.  





































The 15-month MDS program consists of 13 courses – ten required core courses and three electives – for a minimum of 52 units.  

















 

















A key component to the program is the capstone project where you engage with our industry partners to develop models to mine insights. Under the supervision of faculty and industry professionals, the capstone project provides you with the preparation in project design, development, professional writing and oral presentation to be a leader in the field.

Capstone Project 







The Capstone Project provides students the opportunity to work on real-life data science problems with industry partners. The projects are comprehensive in scope, allowing students to demonstrate the breadth and depth of knowledge in data science. The Capstone Project will develop an empirically-driven solution to sponsoring organizations and will cover the full spectrum of the analytic process, from data gathering, manipulation, visualization, analysis, and interpretation of results. Students will work in small groups to put concepts and techniques together and put them in action.
