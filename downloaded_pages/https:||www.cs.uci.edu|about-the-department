About the department
Computer science is the catalyst for every evolutionary — and revolutionary — step in computer development. From mathematical theories, data structures and algorithms to the operating systems and programs that employ them, an understanding of computer science is essential if you wish to develop the next advances in computer technology and applications.The Department of Computer Science in the School of Information and Computer Science, is internationally recognized as a unique group of faculty, visiting researchers, students and educational programs. Computer science faculty conduct research in numerous aspects of computer science including:

Artificial Intelligence: Automated Reasoning / Machine Learning / Data Mining Large-Scale Data Analysis: Information Access & Management / Databases / Information Infrastructure
Bio-Medical Informatics / Computational Biology Urban Crisis Response
Computer Systems Design Embedded Computer Systems
Network and Distributed Systems Mobile Technology
Systems Software: Operating Systems / Compilers / Programming Languages Security & Cryptography
Theory: Analysis of Algorithms and Data Structures Computer Graphics / Visualization
Internet Computing Ubiquitous Computing and Applications

This research is performed in an open and interdisciplinary culture: faculty and students frequently are part of multiple research groups, continuously fostering new collaborations, and are at the forefront of addressing core issues in computer science.
