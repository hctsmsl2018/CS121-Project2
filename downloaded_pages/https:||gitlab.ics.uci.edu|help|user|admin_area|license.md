When you install a new GitLab instance without a license, only Free features
are enabled. To enable more features in GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE), activate

You must have GitLab 14.1 or later.
Your instance must be connected to the internet.

Your subscription confirmation email.
The Customers Portal, on the Manage Purchases page.


Sign in to your GitLab self-managed instance.
On the top bar, select Menu > Admin.
On the left sidebar, select Subscription.
Paste the activation code in Activation code.
Read and accept the terms of service.

Troubleshooting

Cannot activate instance due to connectivity error
This error occurs when you use an activation code to activate your instance, but your instance is unable to connect to the GitLab servers.

You have an offline environment: Configure your setup to allow connection to GitLab servers. If connection to GitLab servers is not possible, contact GitLab support to request a license key.

Firewall settings: Enable an encrypted HTTPS connection from your GitLab instance to customers.gitlab.com (with IP addresses 104.18.26.123 and 104.18.27.123) on port 443.

Customers Portal is not operational: To check for performance or service disruptions, check the Customers Portal status.
