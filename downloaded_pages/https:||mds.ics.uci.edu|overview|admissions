Selection criteria include experiences and attributes as well as academic performance. These criteria are:

Used to assess applicants in light of their unique backgrounds and with the intent of creating a richly diverse selection pool and student body,
Applied equitably across the entire candidate pool, and
Supported by student performance data that show that specific experiences or characteristics are linked to that individual’s likelihood of success as a student and professional in the field of data science. 

The Master of Data Science considers each applicant’s potential contribution to both the school and the field of data science, allowing the admissions committee the flexibility to weigh and balance the range of criteria needed in a class to achieve our mission and goals.

Application Review

The Master of Data Science uses a Holistic Review process, which refers to mission-aligned admissions processes that consider applicants’ experiences, attributes, and academic metrics, as well as the value an applicant, would contribute to learning, practice, and teaching. Holistic Review allows admissions committees to consider the “whole” applicant, rather than disproportionately focusing on any one factor.
Core PrinciplesApplicant selection criteria are broad, clearly linked to the University of California, Irvine, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, and the Master of Data Science mission and goals, and promote numerous aspects of diversity as essential to excellence. 
Selection criteria include experiences and attributes as well as academic performance. These criteria are:

Used to assess applicants in light of their unique backgrounds and with the intent of creating a richly diverse selection pool and student body,
Applied equitably across the entire candidate pool, and
Supported by student performance data that show that specific experiences or characteristics are linked to that individual’s likelihood of success as a student and professional in the field of data science. 

The Master of Data Science considers each applicant’s potential contribution to both the school and the field of data science, allowing the admissions committee the flexibility to weigh and balance the range of criteria needed in a class to achieve our mission and goals.

The Master of Data Science uses a Holistic Review process, which refers to mission-aligned admissions processes that consider applicants’ experiences, attributes, and academic metrics, as well as the value an applicant, would contribute to learning, practice, and teaching. Holistic Review allows admissions committees to consider the “whole” applicant, rather than disproportionately focusing on any one factor.
Core PrinciplesApplicant selection criteria are broad, clearly linked to the University of California, Irvine, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, and the Master of Data Science mission and goals, and promote numerous aspects of diversity as essential to excellence. 
Selection criteria include experiences and attributes as well as academic performance. These criteria are:

Used to assess applicants in light of their unique backgrounds and with the intent of creating a richly diverse selection pool and student body,
Applied equitably across the entire candidate pool, and
Supported by student performance data that show that specific experiences or characteristics are linked to that individual’s likelihood of success as a student and professional in the field of data science. 

The Master of Data Science considers each applicant’s potential contribution to both the school and the field of data science, allowing the admissions committee the flexibility to weigh and balance the range of criteria needed in a class to achieve our mission and goals.

Application Review

The Master of Data Science uses a Holistic Review process, which refers to mission-aligned admissions processes that consider applicants’ experiences, attributes, and academic metrics, as well as the value an applicant, would contribute to learning, practice, and teaching. Holistic Review allows admissions committees to consider the “whole” applicant, rather than disproportionately focusing on any one factor.
Core PrinciplesApplicant selection criteria are broad, clearly linked to the University of California, Irvine, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science, and the Master of Data Science mission and goals, and promote numerous aspects of diversity as essential to excellence. 
Selection criteria include experiences and attributes as well as academic performance. These criteria are:

Used to assess applicants in light of their unique backgrounds and with the intent of creating a richly diverse selection pool and student body,
Applied equitably across the entire candidate pool, and
Supported by student performance data that show that specific experiences or characteristics are linked to that individual’s likelihood of success as a student and professional in the field of data science. 

The Master of Data Science considers each applicant’s potential contribution to both the school and the field of data science, allowing the admissions committee the flexibility to weigh and balance the range of criteria needed in a class to achieve our mission and goals.
