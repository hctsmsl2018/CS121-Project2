Exploring the unexplored in social software development platforms 



André – sharing his thoughts about hard problems in software engineering
On a sunny but slightly cool Friday in Irvine, lead researchers and their students gathered to present their current research pursuits, find common interests, and define future collaborations. 
We would like to express our gratitude to Debra Brodbeck (Assistant Director of ISR) and David Redmiles (ICS professor) for organizing and coordinating this workshop.
