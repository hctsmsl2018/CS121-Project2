Eric Bodden authored Jan 25, 2015

Fix for a long outstanding bug in the value computation of the IDE phase if followReturnPastSeeds is used. Looking at the original IDE paper, one will see that in phase II the algorithm does the following:
1.) propagate values from all start nodes to call nodes and from call nodes to start nodes of callees (!!!)
2.) propagate from all start nodes to all non call-start nodes
In Heros, however, we do not propagate from *all* start nodes to call nodes but only from the initial seeds!
The problem is now that with followReturnPastSeeds=true we have an unbalanced problem, in which we propagate into callers that have no calls ever processed. In result, propagating from initial seeds to calls is not enough, as this will only enable value computation in callees, but not in callers.
The implemented fix memorizes all values propagated into callers in an unbalanced way as so-called "caller seeds" and then uses these also as seeds for value computation. This should fix the problem without having to compute values starting at any start node of any procedure of the program.
