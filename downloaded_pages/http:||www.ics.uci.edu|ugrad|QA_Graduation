Once the online Application has been submitted, only a Bren School academic counselor may make changes to it.

»Commencement and Honors 
Commencement: Visit the official website of the UCI Commencement Office for full information
Latin Honors: 
Of the graduating seniors, no more than 16 percent will receive academic honors: approximately 2 percent summa cum laude, 4 percent magna cum laude, and 10 percent cum laude. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. The student’s cumulative record at the end of the final quarter is the basis for consideration for awarding Latin Honors.
Schools award Latin honors according to overall grade-point average (GPA) at graduation. Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude minimum GPA requirements change annually. For Latin Honors, the academic year ranges from the Fall quarter to the following Summer quarter; for example, the 2021—22 academic year GPA benchmarks apply to seniors graduating in the Fall 2021, Winter 2022, Spring 2022, and Summer 2022 quarters. Latin Honors are noted on official transcripts and diplomas.
Requirements are subject to yearly change and other eligibility restrictions, including disciplinary and academic integrity violations. 
Note: latin honors designations are finalized after your final quarter grades are determined. Students who are eligible for latin honors based on the previous quarter's grades may see their designation go up, down, or off the latin honors scale.
For Information on this year's Latin Honors GPA requirements please visit the Registrar's Latin Honors page.
» Transcript and Diploma 
Degrees are posted to official transcripts approximately six to seven weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are conferred. 
Diplomas will be available approximately four months after the quarter in which the degree was awarded.  The Registrar’s Office will notify you by mail when your diploma is available. More information is available on the Registrar's website.
Upon graduation, academic records may not be changed. It is your responsibility to check the accuracy of your academic record, and to resolve all I and NR grades, before you graduate.

»Commencement and Honors 
Commencement: Visit the official website of the UCI Commencement Office for full information
Latin Honors: 
Of the graduating seniors, no more than 16 percent will receive academic honors: approximately 2 percent summa cum laude, 4 percent magna cum laude, and 10 percent cum laude. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. The student’s cumulative record at the end of the final quarter is the basis for consideration for awarding Latin Honors.
Schools award Latin honors according to overall grade-point average (GPA) at graduation. Summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude minimum GPA requirements change annually. For Latin Honors, the academic year ranges from the Fall quarter to the following Summer quarter; for example, the 2021—22 academic year GPA benchmarks apply to seniors graduating in the Fall 2021, Winter 2022, Spring 2022, and Summer 2022 quarters. Latin Honors are noted on official transcripts and diplomas.
Requirements are subject to yearly change and other eligibility restrictions, including disciplinary and academic integrity violations. 
Note: latin honors designations are finalized after your final quarter grades are determined. Students who are eligible for latin honors based on the previous quarter's grades may see their designation go up, down, or off the latin honors scale.
For Information on this year's Latin Honors GPA requirements please visit the Registrar's Latin Honors page.
» Transcript and Diploma 
Degrees are posted to official transcripts approximately six to seven weeks after the end of the quarter in which they are conferred. 
Diplomas will be available approximately four months after the quarter in which the degree was awarded.  The Registrar’s Office will notify you by mail when your diploma is available. More information is available on the Registrar's website.
Upon graduation, academic records may not be changed. It is your responsibility to check the accuracy of your academic record, and to resolve all I and NR grades, before you graduate.
