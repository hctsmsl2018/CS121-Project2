Xu Receives SLDS Student Paper Award
January 26, 2022 

Statistics Ph.D student Qi Xu’s paper, “Crowdsourcing utilizing subgroup structures of latent factor modeling,” was one of five winning papers recognized recently by the Statistical Learning and Data Science (SLDS) Section of the American Statistical Association. The SLDS hosts an annual student paper competition that is extremely competitive, this year selecting only five student papers from more than 85 submissions. As one of the award recipients, Xu’s paper will be presented at the 2022 Joint Statistical Meetings in August during a special topic-contributed session. Xu’s current research interests are latent factor modeling and deep learning, and their application in crowdsourcing and personalized medicine. His thesis advisor is Chancellor’s Professor of Statistics Annie Qu.
