Congrats Dr. Nick! 



Congratulations to Nick Mangano, who successfully defended his Ph.D. dissertation entitled ‘Calico: an early-phase software design tool’ on September 18, with a committee of Gary Olson, David Redmiles, and Marian Petre (in addition to his advisor, of course).  After 6 years of very hard work, Nick is now off to make a commercial version of Calico that we hope will be a smashing success!
