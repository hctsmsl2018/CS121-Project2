Steven Arzt authored Oct 10, 2013

1) semantic fix: unbalanced returns are associated with a caller-side zero fact as context (d1), not with an empty list of contexts. This allows us to distinguish whether we actually have no caller to which to return or whether we have an unconditional taint.

2) code merge from Reviser: Allowing jump functions to be deleted
