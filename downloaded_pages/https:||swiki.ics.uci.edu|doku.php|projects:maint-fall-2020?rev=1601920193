Downtime Notice: #77051: TSM Backups Paused


 Date:  October 2020

 Duration:  Unknown

 Reason:  The ZFS pool is currently configured as a RAIDZ (RAID5).  In order to enhance the reliability of the RAID we're going to go ahead and setup a RAIDZ2 (RAID6) with a pair of parity drives.

 Affects:  New monthly tape backups will be paused during this period.  Snapshots are still available
