UCI gets unprecedented attention in Siggraph 2012


We had two papers in Siggraph 2012 from UCI. This is the first time we have had papers in Siggraph from UCI. Our paper on new enhanced resolution projection based displays was one of the four papers in the sole session on Computational Displays -- a very new emerging area in computer graphics and visualilzation community. The other papers were from MIT, Stanford and UC-Berkeley. We are very proud to wrestle a spot amongst such well-know players. The second paper was a joint work with Purdue University and was in the Appearance section. The other papers were from Yale University, MIT, Microsoft Research and HP Labs.

IEEE VR 2012 is the premier international conference and exhibition on virtual reality.
You will find the brightest minds, the most innovative  research, the leading companies and the most stimulation discussions in  the fields of virtual environments, augmented reality, 3D user  interfaces, all gathered in Orange County, California during March 4-8  (Sun-Thu), 2012. We invite you to submit your work, show your products  and join us for a fascinating week of presentations, exhibits,  workshops, tutorials and special events.

                                                            Once again, IEEE VR 2012 is pleased to be co-located with IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (March 4-5). In addition, this time we are co-locating ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics,  2012 with IEEE VR. ACM I3D will happen just following IEEE VR on March  9-11, 2012 at the same venue. We hope that the co-location of these two  conferences with large overlapping domains and interest will bring forth  new ways to support cross-fertilization of ideas.
IEEE VR, hosted by  University of California, Irvine, will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  in Orange County, CA. Orange County belongs to the greater Los Angeles  (LA) area which is one of the biggest academic and IT centers of USA.  UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and  Cal-State Fullerton are the main academic centers of the area. Los  Angeles, Irvine, Westminister and other such towns of the area are the  home of thousands of IT companies including gaming (e.g. Blizzard),  entertainment (e.g. Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar, Institute for Creative  Technologies), and devices (e.g. BenQ, Canon). With the co-location of  IEEE 3DUI and ACM I3D, we will provide ample opportunities for  cross-fertilization of ideas and technology across different synergistic  communities centered around virtual reality.

Majumder Delivers ISVC Keynote



Aditi
                                                            Majumder

Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.
Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.
Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A  2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in  developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being  marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for  advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

                                                            Majumder

Computer science professor Aditi Majumder has been awarded a Best  Paper Award at the IEEE Workshop on Projector and Camera Systems  (PROCAMS) held at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern  Recognition (CVPR) in San Francisco.  Her paper entitled, "Display Gamut  Reshaping for Color Emulation and Balancing" was coauthored by  researchers at Ostendo Technologies Ltd.
Majumder et al present a hardware-assisted 3D gamut reshaping method  that handles a gamut expansion in LED based DLP displays in emerging  mobile digital light projectors (known commonly as pico-projectors).  These projectors use multiple LED/laser sources instead of a singular  white lamp providing a larger color gamut. The full abstract and paper  can be found here [PDF link].
The IEEE CVPR Workshop on PROCAMS is one of the top international venues  for projector-camera systems researchers and practitioners.
Majumder's research addresses novel projection based displays and  methodologies to register and interact with them - an important problem  to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a  suite of mathematical models, methods and software to register and  interact with large tiled projection based displays.

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder  and graduate student Behzad Sajadi                    have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE  Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston.
The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical  Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering multiple projectors on vertically extruded a  cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with a calibrated stereo camera.
This papers shows that using some simple priors, one  can achieve multiple projector registration on a cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated  camera without any markers on the display.  More importantly, the new method enables use of multiple  overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of  tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the  corners until today.
The full paper can be accessed here:                    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~majumder/docs/VR10.pdf.
IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 is the top international  venue for virtual reality researchers and practitioners.
Professor Majumder's research addresses how to  produce a seamless image on a large-scale tiled display - an important problem to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a suite of mathematical models, methods and software to correct  the geometric, chromatic and luminescent variations that arise when tiling multiple projection displays.

A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent  Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science  professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference held in Atlantic City this month.
The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for  visualization advances for academia, government, and industry. This event brings together researchers and practitioners  with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and technology.

                                                            Once again, IEEE VR 2012 is pleased to be co-located with IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (March 4-5). In addition, this time we are co-locating ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics,  2012 with IEEE VR. ACM I3D will happen just following IEEE VR on March  9-11, 2012 at the same venue. We hope that the co-location of these two  conferences with large overlapping domains and interest will bring forth  new ways to support cross-fertilization of ideas.
IEEE VR, hosted by  University of California, Irvine, will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  in Orange County, CA. Orange County belongs to the greater Los Angeles  (LA) area which is one of the biggest academic and IT centers of USA.  UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and  Cal-State Fullerton are the main academic centers of the area. Los  Angeles, Irvine, Westminister and other such towns of the area are the  home of thousands of IT companies including gaming (e.g. Blizzard),  entertainment (e.g. Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar, Institute for Creative  Technologies), and devices (e.g. BenQ, Canon). With the co-location of  IEEE 3DUI and ACM I3D, we will provide ample opportunities for  cross-fertilization of ideas and technology across different synergistic  communities centered around virtual reality.

                                                            Majumder

Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.
Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.
Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A  2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in  developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being  marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for  advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

                                                            Majumder

Computer science professor Aditi Majumder has been awarded a Best  Paper Award at the IEEE Workshop on Projector and Camera Systems  (PROCAMS) held at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern  Recognition (CVPR) in San Francisco.  Her paper entitled, "Display Gamut  Reshaping for Color Emulation and Balancing" was coauthored by  researchers at Ostendo Technologies Ltd.
Majumder et al present a hardware-assisted 3D gamut reshaping method  that handles a gamut expansion in LED based DLP displays in emerging  mobile digital light projectors (known commonly as pico-projectors).  These projectors use multiple LED/laser sources instead of a singular  white lamp providing a larger color gamut. The full abstract and paper  can be found here [PDF link].
The IEEE CVPR Workshop on PROCAMS is one of the top international venues  for projector-camera systems researchers and practitioners.
Majumder's research addresses novel projection based displays and  methodologies to register and interact with them - an important problem  to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a  suite of mathematical models, methods and software to register and  interact with large tiled projection based displays.

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder  and graduate student Behzad Sajadi                    have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE  Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston.
The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical  Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering multiple projectors on vertically extruded a  cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with a calibrated stereo camera.
This papers shows that using some simple priors, one  can achieve multiple projector registration on a cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated  camera without any markers on the display.  More importantly, the new method enables use of multiple  overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of  tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the  corners until today.

IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 is the top international  venue for virtual reality researchers and practitioners.
Professor Majumder's research addresses how to  produce a seamless image on a large-scale tiled display - an important problem to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a suite of mathematical models, methods and software to correct  the geometric, chromatic and luminescent variations that arise when tiling multiple projection displays.

A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent  Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science  professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference held in Atlantic City this month.
The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for  visualization advances for academia, government, and industry. This event brings together researchers and practitioners  with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and technology.

In addition, this time we are co-locating ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics,  2012 with IEEE VR. ACM I3D will happen just following IEEE VR on March  9-11, 2012 at the same venue. We hope that the co-location of these two  conferences with large overlapping domains and interest will bring forth  new ways to support cross-fertilization of ideas.
IEEE VR, hosted by  University of California, Irvine, will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  in Orange County, CA. Orange County belongs to the greater Los Angeles  (LA) area which is one of the biggest academic and IT centers of USA.  UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and  Cal-State Fullerton are the main academic centers of the area. Los  Angeles, Irvine, Westminister and other such towns of the area are the  home of thousands of IT companies including gaming (e.g. Blizzard),  entertainment (e.g. Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar, Institute for Creative  Technologies), and devices (e.g. BenQ, Canon). With the co-location of  IEEE 3DUI and ACM I3D, we will provide ample opportunities for  cross-fertilization of ideas and technology across different synergistic  communities centered around virtual reality.

Majumder Delivers ISVC Keynote



Aditi
                                                            Majumder

Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.
Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.
Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A  2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in  developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being  marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for  advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

                                                            Majumder

Computer science professor Aditi Majumder has been awarded a Best  Paper Award at the IEEE Workshop on Projector and Camera Systems  (PROCAMS) held at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern  Recognition (CVPR) in San Francisco.  Her paper entitled, "Display Gamut  Reshaping for Color Emulation and Balancing" was coauthored by  researchers at Ostendo Technologies Ltd.
Majumder et al present a hardware-assisted 3D gamut reshaping method  that handles a gamut expansion in LED based DLP displays in emerging  mobile digital light projectors (known commonly as pico-projectors).  These projectors use multiple LED/laser sources instead of a singular  white lamp providing a larger color gamut. The full abstract and paper  can be found here [PDF link].
The IEEE CVPR Workshop on PROCAMS is one of the top international venues  for projector-camera systems researchers and practitioners.
Majumder's research addresses novel projection based displays and  methodologies to register and interact with them - an important problem  to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a  suite of mathematical models, methods and software to register and  interact with large tiled projection based displays.

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder  and graduate student Behzad Sajadi                    have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE  Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston.
The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical  Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering multiple projectors on vertically extruded a  cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with a calibrated stereo camera.
This papers shows that using some simple priors, one  can achieve multiple projector registration on a cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated  camera without any markers on the display.  More importantly, the new method enables use of multiple  overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of  tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the  corners until today.
The full paper can be accessed here:                    http://www.ics.uci.edu/~majumder/docs/VR10.pdf.
IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 is the top international  venue for virtual reality researchers and practitioners.
Professor Majumder's research addresses how to  produce a seamless image on a large-scale tiled display - an important problem to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a suite of mathematical models, methods and software to correct  the geometric, chromatic and luminescent variations that arise when tiling multiple projection displays.

A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent  Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science  professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference held in Atlantic City this month.
The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for  visualization advances for academia, government, and industry. This event brings together researchers and practitioners  with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and technology.

                                                            Majumder

Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.
Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.
Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A  2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in  developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being  marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for  advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

Computer science professor Aditi Majumder has been awarded a Best  Paper Award at the IEEE Workshop on Projector and Camera Systems  (PROCAMS) held at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern  Recognition (CVPR) in San Francisco.  Her paper entitled, "Display Gamut  Reshaping for Color Emulation and Balancing" was coauthored by  researchers at Ostendo Technologies Ltd.
Majumder et al present a hardware-assisted 3D gamut reshaping method  that handles a gamut expansion in LED based DLP displays in emerging  mobile digital light projectors (known commonly as pico-projectors).  These projectors use multiple LED/laser sources instead of a singular  white lamp providing a larger color gamut. The full abstract and paper  can be found here [PDF link].

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder  and graduate student Behzad Sajadi                    have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE  Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston.
The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical  Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering multiple projectors on vertically extruded a  cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with a calibrated stereo camera.
This papers shows that using some simple priors, one  can achieve multiple projector registration on a cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated  camera without any markers on the display.  More importantly, the new method enables use of multiple  overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of  tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the  corners until today.

IEEE Virtual Reality 2010 is the top international  venue for virtual reality researchers and practitioners.
Professor Majumder's research addresses how to  produce a seamless image on a large-scale tiled display - an important problem to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a suite of mathematical models, methods and software to correct  the geometric, chromatic and luminescent variations that arise when tiling multiple projection displays.

A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent  Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science  professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference held in Atlantic City this month.
The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for  visualization advances for academia, government, and industry. This event brings together researchers and practitioners  with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and technology.

A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent  Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science  professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference held in Atlantic City this month.
The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
IEEE Visualization is the premier annual forum for  visualization advances for academia, government, and industry. This event brings together researchers and practitioners  with a shared interest in visualization tools, techniques, and technology.

UCI gets unprecedented attention in Siggraph 2012


We had two papers in Siggraph 2012 from UCI. This is the first time we have had papers in Siggraph from UCI. Our paper on new enhanced resolution projection based displays was one of the four papers in the sole session on Computational Displays -- a very new emerging area in computer graphics and visualilzation community. The other papers were from MIT, Stanford and UC-Berkeley. We are very proud to wrestle a spot amongst such well-know players. The second paper was a joint work with Purdue University and was in the Appearance section. The other papers were from Yale University, MIT, Microsoft Research and HP Labs.

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder  and graduate student Behzad Sajadi will be presenting at the IEEE Visualization 2012 Conference.
The paper, entitled "Using Patterns to Encode Color Information in Dichromats," explores ways to use patterns to represent color.
This paper proposes a technique for using patterns to encode color information for individuals with CVD, in particular for dichromats.  Further, since overlaying patterns does not compromise the underlying original colors, it does not hamper the perception of normal trichromats.

M. Gopi is the Conference Co-chair of I3D and Aditi Majumder is the General Co-chair of VR


IEEE VR 2012 is the premier international conference and exhibition on virtual reality.
You will find the brightest minds, the most innovative  research, the leading companies and the most stimulation discussions in  the fields of virtual environments, augmented reality, 3D user  interfaces, all gathered in Orange County, California during March 4-8  (Sun-Thu), 2012. We invite you to submit your work, show your products  and join us for a fascinating week of presentations, exhibits,  workshops, tutorials and special events.

                                                            Once again, IEEE VR 2012 is pleased to be co-located with IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (March 4-5). In addition, this time we are co-locating ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics,  2012 with IEEE VR. ACM I3D will happen just following IEEE VR on March  9-11, 2012 at the same venue. We hope that the co-location of these two  conferences with large overlapping domains and interest will bring forth  new ways to support cross-fertilization of ideas.
IEEE VR, hosted by  University of California, Irvine, will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa  in Orange County, CA. Orange County belongs to the greater Los Angeles  (LA) area which is one of the biggest academic and IT centers of USA.  UC-Irvine, UC-Los Angeles, University of Southern California, and  Cal-State Fullerton are the main academic centers of the area. Los  Angeles, Irvine, Westminister and other such towns of the area are the  home of thousands of IT companies including gaming (e.g. Blizzard),  entertainment (e.g. Disney, Dreamworks, Pixar, Institute for Creative  Technologies), and devices (e.g. BenQ, Canon). With the co-location of  IEEE 3DUI and ACM I3D, we will provide ample opportunities for  cross-fertilization of ideas and technology across different synergistic  communities centered around virtual reality.

                                                            Majumder

Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.
Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.
Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs. A  2009 recipient of the NSF CAREER award, she has played a key role in  developing the first curved screen multi-projector display being  marketed by NEC/Alienware and is an advisor at Disney Imagineering for  advances in their projection-based theme park rides.

Aditi Majumder, Computer Science Associate Professor, was a keynote speaker at the  International Symposium on Visual Computing  2010, a prestigious graphics and vision conference that brings together renowned researchers from all over the world.Majumder’s talk, “Ubiquitous Displays: A Distributed Network of Active  Displays,” presents her team’s work-in-progress on developing a new  display paradigm in which displays are not mere carriers of information,  but active members of the workspace — interacting with data, user,  environment and other displays. The goal is to integrate such active  displays seamlessly with the environment, making them ubiquitous to  multiple users and data.Majumder’s research aims to make multi-projector displays truly  commodity products and easily accessible to the common man. Her  significant research contributions include photometric and color  registration across multi-projector displays, enabling use of imperfect  projectors in tiled displays, and more recently a distributed framework  for tiled displays via a distributed network of projector-camera pairs.

Computer science professor Aditi Majumder has been awarded a Best  Paper Award at the IEEE Workshop on Projector and Camera Systems  (PROCAMS) held at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern  Recognition (CVPR) in San Francisco.  Her paper entitled, "Display Gamut  Reshaping for Color Emulation and Balancing" was coauthored by  researchers at Ostendo Technologies Ltd.
Majumder et al present a hardware-assisted 3D gamut reshaping method  that handles a gamut expansion in LED based DLP displays in emerging  mobile digital light projectors (known commonly as pico-projectors).  These projectors use multiple LED/laser sources instead of a singular  white lamp providing a larger color gamut. The full abstract and paper  can be found here [PDF link].
The IEEE CVPR Workshop on PROCAMS is one of the top international venues  for projector-camera systems researchers and practitioners.
Majumder's research addresses novel projection based displays and  methodologies to register and interact with them - an important problem  to both the scientific and entertainment fields. Majumder has developed a  suite of mathematical models, methods and software to register and  interact with large tiled projection based displays.

Computer Science Professor Aditi Majumder  and graduate student Behzad Sajadi                    have received the Best Paper Award at the IEEE  Virtual Reality 2010 conference held in Boston.
The paper, entitled "Auto-Calibration of Cylindrical  Multi-Projector Systems," explores registering multiple projectors on vertically extruded a  cylindrical display, which previously was only possible with a calibrated stereo camera.
This papers shows that using some simple priors, one  can achieve multiple projector registration on a cylindrical display using a single uncalibrated  camera without any markers on the display.  More importantly, the new method enables use of multiple  overlapped projectors across corners of a vertically extruded surface with sharp edges. This is of  tremendous benefit to virtual reality display systems like CAVEs, that avoided mounting projectors across the  corners until today.

A paper entitled, "Markerless View-Independent  Registration of Multiple Distorted Projectors on Extruded Surfaces Using an Uncalibrated Camera" by Computer Science  professor Aditi Majumder and graduate student Behzad Sajadi has won the runner up in  the Best Paper Award at the IEEE Visualization 2009 conference held in Atlantic City this month.
The paper presents the first algorithm to geometrically  register multiple projectors in a view-independent manner on a common type of curved surface, vertically extruded  surface, using an uncalibrated camera without attaching any obtrusive markers to the display screen. This simple  markerless registration has the potential to have a large impact on easy set-up and maintenance of large curved  multi-projector displays, common for visualization, edutainment,                 training and simulation applications.
