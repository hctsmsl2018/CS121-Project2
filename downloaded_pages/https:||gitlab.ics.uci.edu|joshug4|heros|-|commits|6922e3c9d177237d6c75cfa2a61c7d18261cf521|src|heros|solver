Final (?) fix for fix intended in 5b67f79d

·
2e040141




Eric Bodden authored Jan 26, 2015


It turns out that for value computation we only need to store the return sites to which we return in an unbalanced way. Then, at these sites, we *always* look up the edge function that goes to this site from the method's start point and the ZERO node! Previously, we did the look not using the ZERO node but using the original source of the path edge in the callee, which is wrong. Fortunately, the fix also makes for an easier implementation.

·
5b67f79d




Eric Bodden authored Jan 25, 2015

Fix for a long outstanding bug in the value computation of the IDE phase if followReturnPastSeeds is used. Looking at the original IDE paper, one will see that in phase II the algorithm does the following:
1.) propagate values from all start nodes to call nodes and from call nodes to start nodes of callees (!!!)
2.) propagate from all start nodes to all non call-start nodes
In Heros, however, we do not propagate from *all* start nodes to call nodes but only from the initial seeds!
The problem is now that with followReturnPastSeeds=true we have an unbalanced problem, in which we propagate into callers that have no calls ever processed. In result, propagating from initial seeds to calls is not enough, as this will only enable value computation in callees, but not in callers.
The implemented fix memorizes all values propagated into callers in an unbalanced way as so-called "caller seeds" and then uses these also as seeds for value computation. This should fix the problem without having to compute values starting at any start node of any procedure of the program.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.

Fix for a long outstanding bug in the value computation of the IDE phase if followReturnPastSeeds is used. Looking at the original IDE paper, one will see that in phase II the algorithm does the following:
1.) propagate values from all start nodes to call nodes and from call nodes to start nodes of callees (!!!)
2.) propagate from all start nodes to all non call-start nodes
In Heros, however, we do not propagate from *all* start nodes to call nodes but only from the initial seeds!
The problem is now that with followReturnPastSeeds=true we have an unbalanced problem, in which we propagate into callers that have no calls ever processed. In result, propagating from initial seeds to calls is not enough, as this will only enable value computation in callees, but not in callers.
The implemented fix memorizes all values propagated into callers in an unbalanced way as so-called "caller seeds" and then uses these also as seeds for value computation. This should fix the problem without having to compute values starting at any start node of any procedure of the program.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.

2e040141




Eric Bodden authored Jan 26, 2015


It turns out that for value computation we only need to store the return sites to which we return in an unbalanced way. Then, at these sites, we *always* look up the edge function that goes to this site from the method's start point and the ZERO node! Previously, we did the look not using the ZERO node but using the original source of the path edge in the callee, which is wrong. Fortunately, the fix also makes for an easier implementation.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.

Final (?) fix for fix intended in 5b67f79d

·
2e040141




Eric Bodden authored Jan 26, 2015


It turns out that for value computation we only need to store the return sites to which we return in an unbalanced way. Then, at these sites, we *always* look up the edge function that goes to this site from the method's start point and the ZERO node! Previously, we did the look not using the ZERO node but using the original source of the path edge in the callee, which is wrong. Fortunately, the fix also makes for an easier implementation.

Fix for a long outstanding bug in the value computation of the IDE phase if...

·
5b67f79d




Eric Bodden authored Jan 25, 2015

Fix for a long outstanding bug in the value computation of the IDE phase if followReturnPastSeeds is used. Looking at the original IDE paper, one will see that in phase II the algorithm does the following:
1.) propagate values from all start nodes to call nodes and from call nodes to start nodes of callees (!!!)
2.) propagate from all start nodes to all non call-start nodes
In Heros, however, we do not propagate from *all* start nodes to call nodes but only from the initial seeds!
The problem is now that with followReturnPastSeeds=true we have an unbalanced problem, in which we propagate into callers that have no calls ever processed. In result, propagating from initial seeds to calls is not enough, as this will only enable value computation in callees, but not in callers.
The implemented fix memorizes all values propagated into callers in an unbalanced way as so-called "caller seeds" and then uses these also as seeds for value computation. This should fix the problem without having to compute values starting at any start node of any procedure of the program.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.
