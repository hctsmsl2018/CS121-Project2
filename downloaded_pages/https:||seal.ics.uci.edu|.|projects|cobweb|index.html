A Search-Based Energy Testing Framework for Android

    The utility of a smartphone is limited by its battery capacity and the ability of its hardware and software to efficiently use the deviceâs battery. To properly characterize the energy consumption of an app and identify energy defects, it is critical that apps are properly tested, i.e., analyzed dynamically to assess the appâs energy properties. However, currently there is a lack of testing tools for evaluating the energy properties of apps. We present COBWEB, a search-based energy testing technique for Android. By leveraging a set of novel models, representing both the functional behavior of an app as well as the contextual conditions affecting the appâs energy behavior, COBWEB generates a test suite that can effectively find energy defects.

How does Cobweb work?

COBWEB , consists of two major components: (1) Model Extractor component that derives the required models for test generation; and (2) Test Generator component that utilizes an evolutionary search-based technique to create system tests. COBWEB âs fitness function rewards the tests based on two criteria: (1) how close they are to covering energy-greedy APIs in the application logic, and (2) how well they contribute to exercising different contextual factors.
