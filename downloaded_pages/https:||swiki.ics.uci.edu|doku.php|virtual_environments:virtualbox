External Documentation


The best documentation on learning and using VirtualBpx is going to be at the VirtualBox website.


Installation at ICS


VirtualBox 6.1 is installed on ICS Openlab Linux systems.  It can be added to any research Linux system as well. VirtualBox is not installed in the ICS Windows computing labs as  VMware is used for certain ICS courses. 


Running VirtualBox


There are no special privileges required but you must have a local Xserver running.


From any managed Linux host where virtualbox is installed, you may run `virtualbox`.  


Hub@ICS


Or via Jupyterhbu@ICS in your preferred browser.


Login with your ICS username and password. 


There will be 3 options of servers to start.  It doesn’t matter which one you choose.


From the Launcher: select Desktop.


Within the desktop open a Terminal.   


You can then ssh to openlab from there: 

ssh -Y  USERNAME@openlab.ics.uci.edu

Off campus access requires the UCI VPN.


Apple/Macintosh


Prerequisite:  Local Xserver via software such as XQuartz.


You can connect via terminal from your Mac with XQuartz running.  Use the -Y option to enable X11 tunneling to your localhost:


The syntax is:

ssh -Y  USERNAME@openlab.ics.uci.edu

Once you sign in with your ICS username and password, VirtualBox is available from /usr/bin/virtualbox.


Off campus access requires ssh keys unless you are using the UCI VPN.


Microsoft Windows


Use an ssh client that has an embedded Xserver such as MobaXterm


MobaXterm


If you are using MobaXterm, create an ssh session to openlab.ics.uci.edu by clicking on the “Session” icon and then “SSH”.


Basic SSH Settings:


 Remotehost:  openlab.ics.uci.edu

 Specify username:  YOUR USERNAME



Advanced SSH Settings:


 X11-Forwarding:  checked



Once you sign in with your ICS username and password, VirtualBox is available from /usr/bin/virtualbox.
Off campus access requires ssh keys unless you are using the UCI VPN.


Other Client


If you are running another X11 server and SSH client, you can tunnel X11 vis ssh by logging into openlab this way:

ssh -Y USERNAME@openlab.ics.uci.edu
