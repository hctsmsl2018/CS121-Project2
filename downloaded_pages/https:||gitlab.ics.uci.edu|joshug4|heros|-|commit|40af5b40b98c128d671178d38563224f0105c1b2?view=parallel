What is IFDS/IDE in the first place?







------------------------------------





------------------------------------







[IFDS](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/199448.199462) is a general framework for solving inter-procedural, finite, distributive subset problems in a flow-sensitive, fully context-sensitive manner. From a user's perspective, IFDS allows static program analysis in a template-driven manner. Users simply define flow functions for an analysis problem but don't need to worry about solving the analysis problem. The latter is automatically taken care of by the solver, in this case by Heros.

[IFDS](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/199448.199462) is a general framework for solving inter-procedural, finite, distributive subset problems in a flow-sensitive, fully context-sensitive manner. From a user's perspective, IFDS allows static program analysis in a template-driven manner. Users simply define flow functions for an analysis problem but don't need to worry about solving the analysis problem. The latter is automatically taken care of by the solver, in this case by Heros.

[IDE](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(96)00072-2) is an extension of IFDS that allows more expressive computations. Heros implements an IDE solver and supports IFDS problems as special cases of IDE.
