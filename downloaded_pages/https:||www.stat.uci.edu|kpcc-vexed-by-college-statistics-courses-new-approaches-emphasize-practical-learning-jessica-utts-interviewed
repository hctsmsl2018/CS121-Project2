KPCC: “Vexed By College Statistics Courses? New Approaches Emphasize Practical Learning” (Jessica Utts interviewed)
October 25, 2019 
College-level math is a big obstacle to graduation for many California students — and statistics is often the biggest roadblock within the curriculum.

Listen to the interview at KPCC.
