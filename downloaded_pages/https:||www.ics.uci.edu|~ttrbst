Thorben Tröbst

        I'm a third year PhD student at UC Irvine supervised by Vijay Vazirani.
        My research interests are mainly combinatorial optimization and related disciplines as well as their applications to computational economics (market design, algorithmic game theory, etc.).
        I also like to think about mathematical logic and formal verification of proofs and programs from time to time.
        

            Before coming to UCI, I completed a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Mathematics at the University of Bonn, Germany.
            There I was advised by Jens Vygen and Stephan Held and primarily worked on vehicle routing problems.
            In particular, I contributed to the BonnTour / DDG vehicle routing solver which is being developed in collaboration with the Deutsche Post DHL Group.
            I also did some work under Peter Koepke on formal mathematics.
            My CV (last update: Feburary 27, 2021) can be found here.
