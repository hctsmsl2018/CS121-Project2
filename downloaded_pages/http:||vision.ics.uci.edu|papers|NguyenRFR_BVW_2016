The Open World of Micro-Videos
Phuc Nguyen, Grégory Rogez, Charless Fowlkes, Deva Ramanan


      Micro-videos are six-second videos popular on social media
networks with several unique properties. Firstly, because of the authoring
process, they contain significantly more diversity and narrative structure
than existing collections of video “snippets”. Secondly, because they
are often captured by hand-held mobile cameras, they contain specialized
viewpoints including third-person, egocentric, and self-facing views
seldom seen in traditional produced video. Thirdly, due to to their continuous
production and publication on social networks, aggregate microvideo
content contains interesting open-world dynamics that reflects the
temporal evolution of tag topics. These aspects make micro-videos an
appealing well of visual data for developing large-scale models for video
understanding. We analyze a novel dataset of 260 thousand microvideos
labeled with 58 thousand tags. To analyze this data, we introduce
viewpoint-specific and temporally-evolving models for video understanding,
defined over state-of-the-art motion and deep visual features.
We conclude that our dataset opens up new research opportunities for
large-scale video analysis, novel viewpoints, and open-world dynamics.
