Corporate Outreach Committee


            The Corporate Outreach Committee for ICSSC is responsible for establishing and maintaining professional and financial relationships with corporate supporters and alumni in the computer science industry.
            These relationships are crucial for receiving financial sponsorship for ICS events, for hosting informational workshops held for UCI students, and for student recruiting purposes.
            Our job is to network with alumni and company representatives to remind them that the School of ICS has national prestige, and to help them find something at UCI that appeals to their outreach and funding interests.
