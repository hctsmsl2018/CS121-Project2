A Strongly Polynomial Algorithm for Linear Exchange Markets 




Date: May 16, 2019					





Time: 2:00 pm					





Room: DBH 4011					





Speaker: Jugal Garg 					





				 (University of Illinois)					











































Abstract: In this talk, I will present the first strongly polynomial algorithm for computing an equilibrium in exchange markets with linear utilities. The exchange market model has been extensively studied since its introduction by Walras in 1874. This problem has a non-separable convex flow formulation and the property that we can find an equilibrium in strongly polynomial time given its support, i.e., the flow variables which are non-zero. Using a variant of Duan and Mehlhorn (DM) algorithm, we gradually reveal new variables that are in the support of equilibrium. We show that a new variable can be revealed in strongly polynomial time if we start the DM algorithm with the best possible solution corresponding to the current revealed set. Finding the best solution can be reduced to solving a linear program (LP). Even though we are unable to solve this LP in strongly polynomial time, we show that it can be approximated by a simpler LP with two variables per inequality that is solvable in strongly polynomial time and it turns out to be good enough to make the overall algorithm run in strongly polynomial time.

A Strongly Polynomial Algorithm for Linear Exchange Markets 




Date: May 16, 2019					





Time: 2:00 pm					





Room: DBH 4011					





Speaker: Jugal Garg 					





				 (University of Illinois)					











































Abstract: In this talk, I will present the first strongly polynomial algorithm for computing an equilibrium in exchange markets with linear utilities. The exchange market model has been extensively studied since its introduction by Walras in 1874. This problem has a non-separable convex flow formulation and the property that we can find an equilibrium in strongly polynomial time given its support, i.e., the flow variables which are non-zero. Using a variant of Duan and Mehlhorn (DM) algorithm, we gradually reveal new variables that are in the support of equilibrium. We show that a new variable can be revealed in strongly polynomial time if we start the DM algorithm with the best possible solution corresponding to the current revealed set. Finding the best solution can be reduced to solving a linear program (LP). Even though we are unable to solve this LP in strongly polynomial time, we show that it can be approximated by a simpler LP with two variables per inequality that is solvable in strongly polynomial time and it turns out to be good enough to make the overall algorithm run in strongly polynomial time.
