 +
 +  * Downtime Notice: Upgrade Mailman Server

 +The mail server running mailman services will be upgrade to 2.1.29. ​ The new version includes improved spam filtering capabilities that should reduce the amount of mail sent to list owners. ​ Users should try their best to avoid sending email to mail lists during this period as there may be some delay in in the processing of mail.

 +
 +=== Openlab20 Release (Ticket #79437) ===
