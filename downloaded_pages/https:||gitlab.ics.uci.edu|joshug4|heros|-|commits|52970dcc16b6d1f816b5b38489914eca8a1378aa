Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 10, 2013

1) semantic fix: unbalanced returns are associated with a caller-side zero fact as context (d1), not with an empty list of contexts. This allows us to distinguish whether we actually have no caller to which to return or whether we have an unconditional taint.

2) code merge from Reviser: Allowing jump functions to be deleted

Steven Arzt authored Sep 18, 2013

Refactored flow function computation to call FlowFunction.computeTargets in a protected method (which can be overwritten by child classes) instead of directly in the solver logic.

The concrete use case was a return flow function which needed access to the context in which it was applied. With this refactoring, one can now simply subclass the solver, overwrite the new protected method and do one's problem-specific magic there.

1) semantic fix: unbalanced returns are associated with a caller-side zero fact as context (d1), not with an empty list of contexts. This allows us to distinguish whether we actually have no caller to which to return or whether we have an unconditional taint.

2) code merge from Reviser: Allowing jump functions to be deleted

Steven Arzt authored Sep 18, 2013

Refactored flow function computation to call FlowFunction.computeTargets in a protected method (which can be overwritten by child classes) instead of directly in the solver logic.

The concrete use case was a return flow function which needed access to the context in which it was applied. With this refactoring, one can now simply subclass the solver, overwrite the new protected method and do one's problem-specific magic there.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 26, 2013

Better be careful with executors: If they are shutting down, no new tasks may be submitted - otherwise, we will just trigger another pointless exception. Secondly, if we increment the number of active executors and only afterwards actually submit the task, we have to make sure that the submission goes through - otherwise out counter is off by one! I now decrement it again if the executor rejects the new task.

Steven Arzt authored Oct 10, 2013

1) semantic fix: unbalanced returns are associated with a caller-side zero fact as context (d1), not with an empty list of contexts. This allows us to distinguish whether we actually have no caller to which to return or whether we have an unconditional taint.

2) code merge from Reviser: Allowing jump functions to be deleted

Steven Arzt authored Sep 18, 2013

Refactored flow function computation to call FlowFunction.computeTargets in a protected method (which can be overwritten by child classes) instead of directly in the solver logic.

The concrete use case was a return flow function which needed access to the context in which it was applied. With this refactoring, one can now simply subclass the solver, overwrite the new protected method and do one's problem-specific magic there.
