 +
 +==== Equipment Purchase Workflow ====
 +
 +  - ICS Support can help get server quotes after being provided system specifications.
 +    * If the client gets server quotes without ICS Support'​s assistance, there needs to be sufficient time given for review (minimum of 1 week).
 +  - Servers are reviewed for:
 +    * Chassis depth and height.  ​
 +    * Maximum power usage (applies especially for GPU servers)
 +    * Power input cord (C13 or C19).  We have been surprised with C19 which we have less outlets for.
 +      * {{:​services:​power_cord.jpg?​200|}}
 +    * Network requirements (10GB, 1GB, fiber, etc)
 +    * Minimum 3 years warranty, with 5 years preferred.
 +  - A helpdesk ticket should be open with the quotes included for customer/​ICS review and approval.
 +
 +==== Installation Workflow ====
 +
 +  - Create IP address with name chosen for the server
 +  - Rack server and install.
 +  - Test max power consumption of server.
 +    * Verify there is enough power capacity for the server
 +    * Label power usage on the server and in DCIM
 +  - Re-rack if necessary or add more power to rack if available.  ​
 +
 +
 +===== Property Tags =====
 +
 +We can look up purchase orders in KFS to determine what equipment a property tag is meant for:

 +  * **IPv4**: ​ The equipment must be capable of using an IPv4 address. ​ At this time we do not offer IPv6 addresses. 
 + 
 +==== Additional Requirements for Managed Equipment ==== 
 + 
 +ICS Computing support can manage equipment that comes complete with minimal warranty. ​  We cannot support self assembled or DIY builds. ​ ICS faculty are welcome to house these systems in the ICS data center, but they must be self managed.

 +
 +==== Equipment Purchase Workflow ====
 +
 +  - ICS Support can help get server quotes after being provided system specifications.
 +    * If the client gets server quotes without ICS Support'​s assistance, there needs to be sufficient time given for review (minimum of 1 week).
 +  - Servers are reviewed for:
 +    * Chassis depth and height.  ​
 +    * Maximum power usage (applies especially for GPU servers)
 +    * Power input cord (C13 or C19).  We have been surprised with C19 which we have less outlets for.
 +      * {{:​services:​power_cord.jpg?​200|}}
 +    * Network requirements (10GB, 1GB, fiber, etc)
 +    * Minimum 3 years warranty, with 5 years preferred.
 +  - A helpdesk ticket should be open with the quotes included for customer/​ICS review and approval.
 +
 +==== Installation Workflow ====
 +
 +  - Create IP address with name chosen for the server
 +  - Rack server and install.
 +  - Test max power consumption of server.
 +    * Verify there is enough power capacity for the server
 +    * Label power usage on the server and in DCIM
 +  - Re-rack if necessary or add more power to rack if available.  ​
 +
 +
 +===== Property Tags =====
 +
 +We can look up purchase orders in KFS to determine what equipment a property tag is meant for:
 +
 +  - Login to https://​portal.uci.edu
 +  - Click on "​Finances/​KFS"​ menu link and then the KFS Homepage under the "Tools & Support"​ section.
 +    * {{:​services:​datacenter:​proptag_1.jpg?​200|}}
 +  - Click on "​Custom Document Search"​ and click on "​Search - Purchase Orders"​.
 +    * {{:​services:​datacenter:​proptag_2.jpg?​200|}}
 +  - Click on the heart icon to make it a favorite so you can see the it from the Home link.
 +    * {{:​services:​datacenter:​proptag_3.jpg?​200|}}
 +  - For the search, just enter the purchase order number in the "​Purchase Order #" field.
 +    * {{:​services:​datacenter:​proptag_4.jpg?​200|}} ​
 +  - The search results will be at the bottom of the page.
 +
 +===== CRAH Units =====
 +
 +The data center is cools vi thre [[https://​heinz-mech.com/​hvac/​crac-units/​crac-vs-crah/#:​~:​text=The%20difference%20between%20a%20CRAC,​control%20valve%20to%20provide%20cooling.|CRAH]] units. ​

 +
 +=== Motor Replacement ===
 +
 +Motors on all three units were replaced by campus facilities in the first half of 20222. ​  ​Lifetime on the motors is projected to be 12 years. ​ We'll need to look at replacing them again in 2034.
