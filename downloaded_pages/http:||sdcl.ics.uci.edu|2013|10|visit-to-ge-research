Visit to GE Research 



SDCL visited GE Research labs in San Ramon. We presented our recent work on software design collaboration and crowd coding. We also had the opportunity to discuss interesting industry challenges in the fields of user experience and collaboration technology.
We kindly thank Roberto Silveira for all the awesome meetings we had with his research peers.
