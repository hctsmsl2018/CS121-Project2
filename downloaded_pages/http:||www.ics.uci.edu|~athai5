For
the 2019-2020 academic year, I will serve as a DECADE PLUS Leadership Coach, where I specialize in
outreach, mentoring, and leadership for first-generation, under-represented
undergraduate student scholars.
I was
previously an undergraduate research assistant in UCSD's Department of Cognitive Science, where I worked on
studies relating to social robotics, animal-robot interaction, and pro-social
reciprocity in rodents within Professor Andrea Chiba's laboratory.
