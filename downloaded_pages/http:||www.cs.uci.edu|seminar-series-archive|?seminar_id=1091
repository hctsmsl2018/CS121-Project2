 Petros Koumoutsakos 


          Herbert S. Winokur, Jr. Professor of Engineering and Applied Sciences, John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences 
          Harvard University

          (Speaker Website) 

          
February 4, 2022

Title:

            Learning Algorithms and Complex systems: Alloys
         


Abstract:


          Over the last thirty years we have experienced more than a billion-fold increase in hardware capabilities and a dizzying pace of acquiring and transmitting massive amounts of data. Learning algorithms have been the beneficiaries of these advances and today they are increasingly embedded in technologies that touch every aspect of humanity. However along with the abundance of promise there is an ever increasing amount of hype, in particular regarding the capabilities of learning algorithms to model, predict and control complex physical systems.
In this talk I would offer a perspective on forming alloys of learning algorithms and simulations for the prediction and control of complex systems.   I will present novel algorithms and a comparative study of back-propagation algorithms for the modeling of chaotic dynamical systems, a fusion of reinforcement learning and scientific computing for modeling and control of complex flow-structure interactions. I will juxtapose successes and failures and  argue that the proper fusion of domain knowledge and machine learning expertise are essential to advance human knowledge.
