Kubernetes Cluster Upgrade


 Downtime Notice: #78583: Upgrade Kubernetes Clusters

 Date: March 22nd , 2021

 Duration: All week  beginning at 0600 and lasting approximately 8 hours

Engineering Tower Generator ATS repair On Jan 30th


 Downtime Notice: #78155 : ICS Data Center Power Event:  Engineering Tower Generator ATS repair

 Date: January 30th, 2020

 Duration: Beginning at  0600 and lasting approximately 8 hours



Campus facilities scheduling an electrical power shut down for the ICS building on 1/30/2021 in order to effect repairs on a failed generator automatic transfer switch.   


Network:  Power will be temporarily reconfigured to make sure all ICS network equipment remains powered during this period.


Computing:  We do not anticipate downtime on any ICS computing during this period.


Environment:  One of three 20 ton air conditioners will be unavailable during this period.  Portable cooling units will be used to supplement the remaining air conditioners.  If the portable cooling units prove unable to maintain a reasonable operating temperature we will begin shutting down non-critical infrastructure followed by hosts generated the greatest amount of heat (e.g. GPU clusters).


OIT:  OIT will be mirroring our efforts to make sure that their equipment in the building is available during this period.


Although we will do our best to avoid downtime during this period, there are many factors that can intersect unexpectedly to cause an outage.  Please send email to helpdesk@ics.uci.edu if you are concerned that this work will cause a hardship on your research and we will work with campus facilities to do our best to accommodate.

Computing:  We do not anticipate downtime on any ICS computing during this period.


Environment:  One of three 20 ton air conditioners will be unavailable during this period.  Portable cooling units will be used to supplement the remaining air conditioners.  If the portable cooling units prove unable to maintain a reasonable operating temperature we will begin shutting down non-critical infrastructure followed by hosts generated the greatest amount of heat (e.g. GPU clusters).


OIT:  OIT will be mirroring our efforts to make sure that their equipment in the building is available during this period.


Although we will do our best to avoid downtime during this period, there are many factors that can intersect unexpectedly to cause an outage.  Please send email to helpdesk@ics.uci.edu if you are concerned that this work will cause a hardship on your research and we will work with campus facilities to do our best to accommodate.
