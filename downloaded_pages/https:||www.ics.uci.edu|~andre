
				André heads the Software Design and Collaboration Laboratory, which focuses on 
                understanding and advancing the role of design, coordination, and education in software development.  His graduate work addressed
				distributed configuration management and versioned software architecture from a strictly technical perspective, but since his arrival at 
				UC Irvine
				he has been positively corrupted by his 
				colleagues 
				in the 
				Department of Informatics 
				to address a broader 
				research agenda
				that integrates a strong focus on people and how they work.
						
				Education is a key interest of André.  He was the 
				principal designer of the new 
				B.S. in Informatics 
				at UC Irvine,
				and is responsible for delivering several courses in this innovative 
				curriculum.  His research bridges into the educational realm by 
                developing and critically evaluating new approaches to teaching 
                software engineering, particularly for those topics that traditionally 
                are difficult to address in the classroom.
