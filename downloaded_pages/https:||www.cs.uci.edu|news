Graduate Student Spotlight: Markelle Kelly Highlights the Human Side of Computer Science
October 15, 2022 

Recognizing the importance of cross-disciplinary work, computer science Ph.D. student Markelle Kelly is partnering with cognitive scientists on her research into human-machine collaboration. “Collaborating with people who are really knowledgeable in this realm results in a much more useful framework than if machine learning researchers tried to reinvent the wheel ourselves,” she says, highlighting ongoing research efforts between UC Irvine’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) and the Department of Cognitive Sciences. In fact, her collaborative approach has helped her earn multiple fellowships at UCI. Last summer, she received a fellowship through UCI’s Steckler Center for Responsible, Ethical, and Accessible Technology (CREATE), and this year she was awarded fellowships through the Irvine Initiative in AI, Law, and Society and the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI at UCI). Here, she talks about her machine learning research and future plans.

October 12, 2022 

The National Science Foundation has awarded $750,000 to a multidisciplinary team from the University of California, Irvine’s Cybersecurity Policy & Research Institute (CPRI), its Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and BlackBerry to address the challenges around secure communications on public 5G networks.
The funds are being allocated under the NSF convergence accelerator program, which supports projects that tackle national problems.

October 12, 2022 
In early September 1859, the most intense geomagnetic storm ever recorded raged in the planet’s atmosphere. … If such an event were to occur in the future, it could theoretically damage power lines and internet cables across many regions, says Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi, [computer science assistant professor] at the University of California, Irvine. “There is also this risk of charged particles causing data corruption,” she adds. “Right now, the actual extent of damage, it’s very difficult to predict.” Daniel Whiteson, [physics and astronomy professor] also at the University of California, Irvine, agrees, adding that such an incident could potentially be “catastrophic” and that our understanding of the physics inside the Sun is not well-developed enough to allow us to be able to predict major solar ejections well in advance.

Senior Spotlight: Tennis Player and CS Major Matthew Sah Serves Up Aces On and Off the Court
September 28, 2022 

As a freshman in high school, Matthew Sah could already envision himself thriving at UCI. That’s why he didn’t hesitate to accept his offer to become an Anteater when he was recruited to play for the UCI Men’s Tennis team the summer before his senior year.
“I really liked the campus, the location and I knew that the school had strong academics in a lot of areas,” says Sah, who is studying computer science. “Some of my favorite parts about going to UCI are the people, academics, being able to live in Newport with my friends and the food.”

September 19, 2022 
How to lose your company in a data breach:
Step 1: Suffer a data breach (which almost all companies have or will);Step 2:  Get sued by plaintiff’s lawyers waiting to pounce or, worse, an Attorney General or regulator;Step 3:  Be found not to have met the applicable “standard of care;”Step 4:  Pay up, and possibly lose your business.
“Standard of Care?”, you say. What’s that and why should I care? And where does NIST fit in?
“Standard of Care” is legalese for the minimum an organization must do to have acted “reasonably” in a lawsuit. In most data breach cases, if you are found not to have acted reasonably, e.g., by not employing sufficiently strong encryption, you likely will have to pay economic damages, sometimes reaching bet-the-company territory. Damages and penalties in a cyber breach case likely will reach $1 billion this decade.

Jose Cisneros
As computer science major Jose Cisneros enters his senior year, he does so with more than a year’s worth of industry experience under his belt and three full-time return offers in hand. His three software engineering internships — at Microsoft, Snap Inc. and Cisco Meraki — have provided a wealth of real-world knowledge, complementing the technical skills gained as a student in the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS). He has developed features for web and iOS applications and networking hardware, written requirement specifications, and helped launch new products.
