Graduate Computer Science Programs
The field of Computer Science is concerned with the design, analysis and implementation of computer systems as well as the use of computation as it is applied to virtually every field of study and use in the everyday world. Core research areas include artificial intelligence and machine learning, bioinformatics, computer architecture, embedded systems, graphics and visual computing, databases and information management, multimedia, networked and distributed systems, programming languages and compilers, security and cryptography, design and analysis of algorithms, scientific computing, and ubiquitous computing. Thus, the graduate degrees offered by the Department of Computer Science must be broad and flexible programs that provide students opportunities for graduate study in the full spectrum of intellectual activity in computer science. The Department of Computer Science currently offers the following graduate degrees:

Professional Master of Computer Science
M.S. and Ph.D. in Computer Science
M.S. and Ph.D. in Networked Systems

For detailed information on the above degrees, visit the program pages or check out the UCI Catalogue.
