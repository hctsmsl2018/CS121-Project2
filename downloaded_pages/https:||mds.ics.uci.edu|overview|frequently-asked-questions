Frequently Asked Questions 






















How is the Master of Data Science different from the Master of Science in Business Analytics degree? 

Data Science and Business Analytics are unique fields, with the biggest difference being the scope of the problems addressed. The science of data that uses algorithms, statistics, and technology is known as Data Science. It provides actionable insights on a range of structured and unstructured data solving a broader perspective such as customer behavior. On the other hand, the statistical study of mostly structured business data is known as Business Analytics. It provides solutions to specific business problems and roadblocks.







Is the Program STEM Designate?

Yes. International students with an F-1 visa can extend their post-graduation time in the U.S. beyond the regular optional practical training (OPT) of 12 months by an additional 24 months, for a total of 36 months of OPT. This allows international students to gain additional work experience in the U.S. in their chosen field of study.







How long Is the Master of Data Science Program? How many Units do I need to Complete it?

The MDS Program is an 15-month (Five-quarter) full-time program. It requires nine core courses and 3 electives, for a total of 48 units to complete the program. All MDS students are expected to complete the program within five consecutive quarters during a consecutive 15-month period.







What is the Capstone Project?

Students complete a group experiential Capstone Project in the last quarter of the program. The project would be drawn from industry and would involve applying Statistical and Computational methods for a company, typically based in Southern California.







What does the Admissions committee look for in an applicant?

We are looking for students that want to become “data scientists” or “Machine learning engineers”; i.e.professionals with the training and skill set to handle big data and gain intelligence from it in order to create value at companies across a range of industries. We evaluate and take into account a number of criteria including test scores, academic performance, essays, resume, work experience, and letters of recommendation. An Admissions Committee will balance the diversity of education, work experience, background, and leadership potential to build a diverse and high quality classroom environment. We encourage you to apply if you have a genuine interest in the program.







Are WES Evaluations Accepted by UC Irvine?

No. Our program staff handles all transcript evaluations and do not accept WES evaluations. WES services are non-binding, meaning they do not have the authority to overrule the evaluations conducted by UCI’s Graduate Division. WES is considered a suggested guide and is not considered an official evaluation of your credentials.

Data Science and Business Analytics are unique fields, with the biggest difference being the scope of the problems addressed. The science of data that uses algorithms, statistics, and technology is known as Data Science. It provides actionable insights on a range of structured and unstructured data solving a broader perspective such as customer behavior. On the other hand, the statistical study of mostly structured business data is known as Business Analytics. It provides solutions to specific business problems and roadblocks.







Is the Program STEM Designate?

Yes. International students with an F-1 visa can extend their post-graduation time in the U.S. beyond the regular optional practical training (OPT) of 12 months by an additional 24 months, for a total of 36 months of OPT. This allows international students to gain additional work experience in the U.S. in their chosen field of study.







How long Is the Master of Data Science Program? How many Units do I need to Complete it?

The MDS Program is an 15-month (Five-quarter) full-time program. It requires nine core courses and 3 electives, for a total of 48 units to complete the program. All MDS students are expected to complete the program within five consecutive quarters during a consecutive 15-month period.







What is the Capstone Project?

Students complete a group experiential Capstone Project in the last quarter of the program. The project would be drawn from industry and would involve applying Statistical and Computational methods for a company, typically based in Southern California.







What does the Admissions committee look for in an applicant?

We are looking for students that want to become “data scientists” or “Machine learning engineers”; i.e.professionals with the training and skill set to handle big data and gain intelligence from it in order to create value at companies across a range of industries. We evaluate and take into account a number of criteria including test scores, academic performance, essays, resume, work experience, and letters of recommendation. An Admissions Committee will balance the diversity of education, work experience, background, and leadership potential to build a diverse and high quality classroom environment. We encourage you to apply if you have a genuine interest in the program.
