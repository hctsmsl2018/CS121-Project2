79437: Reinstall CentOS8 Openlab8 Cluster with Ubuntu 20.04


 Downtime Notice: circinus-49 through circinus-96

 Date: June 14

 Duration:  1 week.



The CentOS8 OS will be retired in December of 2021 and ICS Computing Support will remove it from any user facing environments.  The systems circinus-49 through circinus-96 will be reinstalled with Ubuntu 20.04 at the end of Spring Quarter.


78836 ICS Data Center and CS2 Network Closet Outage


 Downtime Notice: #78836: ICS Data Center and CS2 Network Closet (Work Order 5112353)

 Date: May 4th, 2021 (Confirmed)

 Duration: 

 Building power to be shut off at 2000 on 5/4/2021

 Non-critical hosts shutdown beginning at noon on 5/4/2021

 Some critical services may be unavailable for up to twelve hours.

 It may take several days to restore services on all hosts.





Affects:  All non-critical, research, and instructional computing will be shutdown beginning at noon on 5/4. 


Campus facilities has scheduled an electrical power shut down for the ICS CS2 buildings on May 4th at 8pm.  Most research and instructional equipment during this power will not have power and will be turned shutdown during the day on 5/4.   Equipment will be brought back online on the morning of 5/5.


Network:  Core data center and building network will remain online during this event.  


Computing:  Critical ICS services will remain online (i.e. home directories, web services, email).


Environment:  One of three 20 ton AC units will be available during this period and will be supplemented by a pair of 3 ton portable units.  If the portable cooling units prove unable to maintain a reasonable operating temperature we will begin shutting down additional critical infrastructure.


OIT:  OIT will be mirroring our efforts to make sure that their equipment in the buildings are  available during this period.


Although we will do our best to avoid downtime of critical services during this period, there are many factors that may intersect unexpectedly to cause an outage.  Please send email to helpdesk@ics.uci.edu if you are concerned that this work will cause a hardship on your research and we will work with campus facilities to do our best to accommodate.
