SCALE at IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center 



The SDCL just attended the SCALE conference at IBM’s T.J. Watson Research Center.
There we had the great opportunity to share our current work on on crowd development,
crowd debugging, and social-technical code search.  We also had the privilege to
hear interesting talks  and have engaging discussion by and with IBMers and other SCALE members.
