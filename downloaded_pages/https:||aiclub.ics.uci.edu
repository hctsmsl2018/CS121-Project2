Alexander Ihler




											Professor Ihler is the advisor of AI@UCI. 
											Here are some areas that he has been working on.
											
											"I work in artificial intelligence and machine learning,
											focusing on statistical methods for learning from data and
											on approximate inference techniques for graphical models.
											Applications of my work include data mining and
											information fusion in sensor networks, computer vision and
											image processing, and computational biology."
										
























Stephan Mandt




											Professor Mandt is the advisor of AI@UCI. 
											Here are some areas that he has been working on.
											
											"My primary goal is to develop a new generation of machine
											learning models by drawing on deep learning, probabilistic
											graphical models, and approximate Bayesian inference. My
											research, thus, tries to synthesize representation
											learning and probabilistic modeling. This results in new
											flexible and oftentimes interpretable models for
											unsupervised or semi-supervised learning on large data."
