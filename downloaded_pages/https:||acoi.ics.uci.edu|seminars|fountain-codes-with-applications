Fountain codes with applications 




Date: November 21, 2019					





Time: 2:00 pm					





Room: DBH 4011					





Speaker: Mike Luby 					





				 (ICSI, Berkeley)					











































Abstract: We provide a high level introduction to fountain codes, and describe some of the ways that fountain codes have been used in the past and could potentially be used in the future.  Example future applications that will be described include: (1) reliable distributed storage; (2)  an Internet architecture fundamentally based on fountain codes.  No background knowledge is assumed from the audience.
