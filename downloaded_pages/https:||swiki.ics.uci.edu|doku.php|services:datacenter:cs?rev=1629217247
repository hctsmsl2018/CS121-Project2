 Advanced Out of Band Management:  Often called BMC, iDRAC, IPMI, ILOM, or OOB, out of band management should allowcomplete remote administration with a full console..

 Airflow:  The ICS data center is split into hot and cold aisles.   Any equipment in the data center must take cold air in from the cold aisle and exhaust into a hot aisle. 

 Proper Form Factor:  Equipment must actually fit in a standard rack or a specialty rack must be provided.  Typically, this means the equipment must have a depth of 33” or less.



Provided
