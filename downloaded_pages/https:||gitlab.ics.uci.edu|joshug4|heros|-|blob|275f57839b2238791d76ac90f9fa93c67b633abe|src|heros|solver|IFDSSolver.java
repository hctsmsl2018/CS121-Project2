Eric Bodden authored Jul 05, 2013

changing initialization of analysis such that initialSeeds not is a mapping from units to initial data-flow facts at these units

this is a breaking change, but the class DefaultSeeds can be used to easily convert a set of units (old format) into a default map that should work for current clients

the change was implemented to permit subtypes of IFDSTabulationProblem to overwrite facts at seeds in a convenient way
