If you are one of them, make sure to apply to the Software Engineering doctoral program in ICS. Note that the Software Engineering program is different, and more focused, than the Computer Science program offered by the School. I typically do not supervise students in the CS program. (If you're not sure about your focus and future advisor, apply to both)Masters We have two Masters programs in Software Engineering, one focused on research (MSSE) and the other focused on professional development (MSWE). Choose the one that's right for you.
