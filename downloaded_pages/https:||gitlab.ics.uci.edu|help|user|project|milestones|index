Milestones (FREE)

Milestones in GitLab are a way to track issues and merge requests created to achieve a broader goal in a certain period of time.
Milestones allow you to organize issues and merge requests into a cohesive group, with an optional start date and an optional due date.

Milestones as releases
Milestones can be used to track releases. To do so:

Set the milestone due date to represent the release date of your release and leave the milestone start date blank.
Set the milestone title to the version of your release, such as Version 9.4.
Add an issue to your release by associating the desired milestone from the issue's right-hand sidebar.

Additionally, you can integrate milestones with the Releases feature.

Project milestones and group milestones
A milestone can belong to project or group.
You can assign project milestones to issues or merge requests in that project only.
You can assign group milestones to any issue or merge request of any project in that group.
For information about project and group milestones API, see:

Project Milestones API
