====== Fall Quarter 2016 Announcements (work in progress) ======

==== Instructional Lab Updates ====

== Keeping Instructional Labs Clean ==

Instructors, please urge your TAs to enforce the "NO FOOD or DRINKS" rule in the Instructional Labs.  The care for the labs is everyone's responsibility.

There are brand new chairs and desks in the first floor labs.  The carpets were replaced, and the walls were painted last summer.  Please make sure that your TAs and especially your students understand that we are all caretakers of this space.  How we leave these labs to the next crop of students reflects on all of us.  Everyone is encouraged to contact their TA, the lab attendant in CS 364 at x47553, or Computing Support at x44222 to report lab rule violations.

== Openlab Changes ==

    * Added 40 more 8-core HP Proliant 360 G5's with 32GB RAM
    * Upgraded to CentOS 7 for Fall quarter
    * Consolidated openlab.q with no time limits

More information on the [[:hardware:cluster:openlab|Openlab Cluster]]

More information on using [[:services:sun_grid_engine|Son of Grid Engine Queueing System (SGE)]]

== Undergraduate Scratch Space ==

Two (2) TB of space on the Bren School's filer have been set aside for undergraduate instruction scratch space. The space is available to both Windows (smb) and ICS-supported Linux (nfs) clients.

Researchers are expected to pay for any infrastructure costs associated with their equipment and are occasionally asked to help with general infrastructure costs for running the data center.

----

==== SSL Certificates for ICS Hosts ====

UC Irvine is participating in the InCommon Certificate program, which allows delegated administrators in campus departments to issue and renew digital certificates used for such purposes as securing web servers run on behalf of their departments.  Through the InCommon Certificate program, UC Irvine pays a site fee (sponsored by OIT) and is then entitled to issue unlimited digital certificates through Comodo, a well-established commercial Certificate Authority.

More information about this program is available at the [[http://www.incommonfederation.org/cert|InCommon]] site.

ICS has a 1600-square-foot data center and manages 571 pieces of equipment in the data center, including 479 bare metal servers.  More statistics are available [[:vital_statistics|here]].

ICS researchers may place [[:services:supported_hardware|supported hardware]] in the ICS data center free of recurring charges.

==== SSL Certificates for ICS Hosts ====

UC Irvine is participating in the InCommon Certificate program, which allows delegated administrators in campus departments to issue and renew digital certificates used for such purposes as securing web servers run on behalf of their departments.  Through the InCommon Certificate program, UC Irvine pays a site fee (sponsored by OIT) and is then entitled to issue unlimited digital certificates through Comodo, a well-established commercial Certificate Authority.

More information about this program is available at the [[http://www.incommonfederation.org/cert|InCommon]] site.
